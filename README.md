# Welcome to ZZSC9020 GitHub repository for group [The What Watts - Group A]

This GitHub repository is the main point of access for students and lecturers of the ZZSC9020 capstone course. 

In this repository, you will find the data to start developing your project. Also, we will use the repository to share code, documentation, data, models and other resources between the group members and course lecturers.

Complete the information below regarding your group.

### Brief project description
This project is using the a collection of data for energy demand and weather, it is deisgned to provide synthetic data for modeling of future energy scenarios.

## Repository structure

The repository has the following folder structure:

- agendas: agendas for each weekly meeting with lecturers (left 24h before the next meeting)
- checklists: teamwork checklist or a link to an account in a project task management tool
- data: datasets for analysis
- gantt_chart: Gantt chart or a link to an account in a project task management tool
- minutes: minutes for each meeting (left not more than 24h after the corresponding meeting)
- report: RMarkdown or Jupyter notebook report in progress
- src: source code

## Collaborative Tools
### Group meeting software
- Zoom & Webex

Reason: As we are regularly communicating through whats app via messaging, it was important that in a twice weekly status and retrospective we met face to face, zoom and webex both offer these features

### Software used to manage work collaboratively
- Github [https://github.com/Jimbobaus/project---What-Watts---Group-A/], Jira [https://zzcs9020-groupa.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WW/boards/1/roadmap], Google Drive [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1qLVyU_Nj5m9H9YgDEdrRpft6awg0tCxM], Other (MyBib [https://www.mybib.com/j/AheadCertainChicken])

Reason: Github is fantastic for source code management, ensuring that we commit updated code at the correct time.
As we are taking an agile approach and want to pull work, rather than push work, Jira was chosen
For document creation, the ability for simultaneous editing was essential, hence we chose google drive
MyBib is for collaborative referencing

### Software used for data analysis
- Python, Other (Google Colab [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IXj4h4qc0tjctBQyXK6PHkSzmOgObEb_], Power BI [app.powerbi.com])

Reason: The industry is moving towards Python and it has all the features that we require
The capstone is an opportunity to extend our Python skills
Google Colab provides both GPU and the ease of sharing code efficiently with each other
Power BI is useful for data visualisation

### Software used to write group report in a reproducible manner
- Google Colab [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IXj4h4qc0tjctBQyXK6PHkSzmOgObEb_] and Rmarkdown

Reason: As our report will require some generated output, with formatting, Rmarkdown was chosen as it enables us to run the code inside the document, before knitting into the final document, It also provides the flexibility of LaTex to format the output, As Rmarkdown can run both python and R code, it was a good choice. As our coding is being done in GOogle Colab, the code required for Rmarkdown will be generated or taken from there. 

### Software used for oral presentation
- Powerpoint, RShiny [https://shiny.rstudio.com/]

Reason: For components of the audio presentation it is important to have key concepts displayed, often in a static format so that the explanations take priority, this will be done with Powerpoint
For components where visualisations and interactive components showcased, we will use Rshiny

### List of additional software
- Draw.io [https://app.diagrams.net/#HJimbobaus%2Fproject%2Fmain%2Fminutes%2FThe%20Big%20Fans.drawio], as a online collaborative mind mapping tool
- Whatsapp for daily virtual standups
